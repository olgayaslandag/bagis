<h2>What Is Bagis?</h2>
<p>
It is a system that the end consumer can access by scanning the QR code on the product with their phone. When the consumer reaches the system, he/she requests to donate to some organizations with which an agreement has been made by the relevant company, and instructions and payments are made by the relevant company to the organization to which the donation is made.

<h2>Server Requirements</h2>
<p>PHP version 5.6 or newer is recommended.
</p>

<p>
It should work on 5.4.8 as well, but we strongly advise you NOT to run such old versions of PHP, because of potential security and performance issues, as well as missing features.
